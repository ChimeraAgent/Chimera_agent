Project Chimera is an open-source framework for building sophisticated autonomous AI agents capable of complex reasoning, planning, and interaction within dynamic environments.

## Core Principles

- **Modularity:** Designed for extensibility and maintainability through a modular architecture.
- **Adaptability:** Emphasizes continuous learning and adaptation to changing conditions.
- **Interoperability:** Facilitates seamless integration with various external systems and APIs.

## Architecture

The framework comprises the following core modules:

- **Perception:** Processes multimodal input (text, vision, etc.) using advanced models.
- **Cognition:** Handles reasoning, planning, and knowledge management.
- **Action:** Executes actions in the environment via defined interfaces.
- **Memory:** Stores and retrieves information relevant to the agent's operation.
- **Learning:** Implements algorithms for continuous improvement.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <https://github.com/your-username/project-chimera.git`>
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure environment variables (see `.env.example`).
4. Run a sample agent: `python examples/run_basic_agent.py`
